# Invisi

* An image masking and manipulation project made in Python which renders a particular colorspace see-through.
* Uses OpenCV and Numpy to capture and mask camera input frames to achieve see-throughness.
* Works in HSV (Hue-Saturation-Value) colorspace for facilitated color extraction.
* Uses trackbars for immediate change in HSV values, eliminating the need for manual code input.

## Concepts Used - 

1. Image Masking
2. Image Thresholding
3. HSV colorspace

## To run - 

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the **cloak.py** file.
3. Let the camera initialise with an initial frame for 1 second.
4. Bring a cloak or any other piece of clothing and tweak the HSV values according to requirements.
5. Press **q** to quit.

### Python version used -

### Modules - 

1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - 1.19.5
2. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) - 4.5.3
